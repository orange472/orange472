# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Tony, and I am currently a student at Yale University majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. Some classes that I've taken so far include Systems Programming, Data Structures, Algorithms, and Fullstack Development. 

In my free time, I am working on [StudyBlock](https://www.studyblock.net), a learning tool that combines Tetris with flashcards. Feel free to reach out to me for more information!
